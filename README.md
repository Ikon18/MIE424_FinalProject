## Quick User Guide

EvoloPy toolbox contains twenty three benchamrks (F1-F23). The main file is the optimizer.py, which considered the interface of the toolbox. In the optimizer.py you can setup your experiment by selecting the optmizers, the benchmarks, number of runs, number of iterations, and population size. 
The following is a sample example to use the EvoloPy toolbox.  
Select optimizers from the list of available ones: "SSA","PSO","GA","BAT","FFA","GWO","WOA","MVO","MFO","CS","HHO","SCA","JAYA","DE". For example:
```
optimizer=["SSA","PSO","GA"]  
```

After that, Select benchmark function from the list of available ones: "F1","F2","F3","F4","F5","F6","F7","F8","F9","F10","F11","F12","F13","F14","F15","F16","F17","F18","F19". For example:
```
objectivefunc=["F3","F4"]  
```

Select number of repetitions for each experiment. To obtain meaningful statistical results, usually 30 independent runs are executed for each algorithm.  For example:
```
NumOfRuns=10  
```
Select general parameters for all optimizers (population size, number of iterations). For example:
```
params = {'PopulationSize' : 30, 'Iterations' : 50}
```
Choose whether to Export the results in different formats. For example:
```
export_flags = {'Export_avg':True, 'Export_details':True, 'Export_convergence':True, 'Export_boxplot':True}
